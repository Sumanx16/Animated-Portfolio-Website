A personal portfolio website built with a focus on smooth, dynamic animations and a minimalist design. This project serves as a showcase of my web development skills, featuring a custom mouse cursor and interactive project displays.

## 🚀 Features

* **Smooth Scrolling**: Utilizes the Locomotive Scroll library for a fluid and polished scrolling experience.
* **Dynamic Animations**: Powered by GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) to create engaging animations on scroll and page load.
* **Interactive Project Showcase**: Each project element reacts to the cursor, revealing a corresponding image and creating a unique hover effect.
* **Custom Cursor**: A small circle cursor that morphs and follows the user's mouse, adding a layer of interactivity.
* **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a great experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
